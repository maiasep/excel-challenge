  Conclusions on the data:
    1. When thinking about the best categorties for crowdsourcing efforts, Film & Vdieo would have the largest success rate in terms of campaign outcome. 
    2. Generally the best months to crowdfund occur in June and July comparitve to other months in the year.
    3. Based on the central tendency of the count of backers, the successful campaigns typically see a larger number of backers to their campaigns. If one decides to run a campaign, they should have more backers. 

Limitations: 
  One limitation in the data is that the currencies of the donations are all in different currencies depending on the country making it harder to draw a standardized conclusion. Another limitation of the data is the amount of time that the snapshot was taken. It would be interesting to see a larger time frame given to see how COVID may have affected results. 

Additional tables:
  1. Table comparing the success of campaign categories over years. Given this information crowdfunders could see a trend in what could potentially be popular next year to ensure a successful outcome.
  2. Table showing the pledged amounts year over year to draw conclusions on likelihood of hitting goals in a crowdfunding campaign. This would allow crowdfunders to create realistic goals given the time to ensure successful outcomes.

Mean or median?
  Given the large variance among the data set, we would want to use the median over the mean

Comparing the variance:
  Threre is more variability with successful campaigns. This makes sense because successful campaigns are more likely to acheive higher funding amounts than unsuccessful campaigns.
